# library-system
This project is a work to be used by a library employee. Our user (admin) is a library employee. We enable the library staff to do some operations in a more systematic and easy way.  What can the project do?  There are 10 categories in our menu, including exit. With these categories, the admin can add and remove students, add or remove books to the system. View all students and view any student. In the same way, all books and any book can be showed. They can send a book to a student by cargo and view the price they will pay. These are the features that the library staff can use.
